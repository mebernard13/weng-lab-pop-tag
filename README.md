Methodology for identifying population tags in LitCovid publication abstracts

## Manual Methodology

### Step 1: Collect PMIDs

PMIDs are unique identifiers for each publication within the LitCovid database. Links to respective publications are based on the following hyperlink format:

    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/publication/ **<pmid>**

### Step 2: Confirm that the publication is within the scope of the COVID-19 PICO project

In order to be within the scope of the project, the publication must be:

1. Related to COVID-19
2. Involving human subjects on the clinical level

Any publications that are on LitCovid and not within the scope should be removed from consideration.

### Step 3: Identify mention of "patients" or "cases" within the abstract

Some abstracts do not have mention of unique sections with the following format or similar (in most cases, the section names would be bolded or italicized and include a colon):
